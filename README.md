## About

I always had a problem when looking for an place to stay in Amsterdam, where to look for it.
The agencies are too expensive, Kamernet or Craiglist are full of spam and Facebook is too chaotic.
That's why I created House Hunter, a platform where you can find all Facebook's posts of the main house renting groups organized in offers and requests.

*This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.*

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/project; npm install
    ```

3. Start your app

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Testing

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g feathers-cli             # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers generate model                 # Generate a new Model
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
